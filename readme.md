## Overview 📝

This README serves to document my experience with a backend unit testing project, focusing on using Mocha for testing various functions.

---

## What I've Done 🎯

- Created a folder `bootcamp-terminal-tests` to house the project.
- Created a sub-folder named `test` within, where all test files reside.
- Developed several functions such as `greet`, `isFromBellville`, `regCheck`, etc.
- Each function is in its own file, named `<THE FUNCTION NAME>.js`, and exported as a module.
- Created corresponding test files for each function, named `<THE FUNCTION NAME>.test.js`.
- Successfully set up Mocha as a development dependency using npm.

## Skills & Learnings 📘

### Skills I Knew:

- I already knew how to set up Mocha.
- Familiar with creating test files.
- Adept at using `describe` and `assert.equal` in tests.

### New Skills Acquired:

- Learned to use npm for installing Mocha as a dev dependency.
- Mastered importing the `assert` library for tests.
- Learned to set up a badge in the GitHub repo to indicate test status.

---

## Challenges 🚧

- Initially faced some difficulties in setting up the badge for test verification. However, I managed to overcome this challenge.

---

## Conclusion 🌟

This project was instrumental in enhancing my backend testing skills. I not only got to apply what I already knew but also picked up new skills that will be beneficial for future projects. The challenges faced were minor and educational, adding to the overall learning experience.
